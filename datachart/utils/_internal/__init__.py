"""Internal utilities module for datachart.

This module contains internal implementation details that are not part of the
public API. These utilities are used internally by the datachart package and
should not be imported directly by external code.

The internal module includes:
    - plot_engine: Core chart plotting and rendering logic
    - config_helpers: Configuration and attribute helper functions
    - colors: Color scale and colormap utilities

Note:
    This module is considered private and may change without notice.
    Use the public API exported from `datachart.utils` instead.
