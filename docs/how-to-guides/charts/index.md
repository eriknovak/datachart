# Charts

The [datachart.charts](../../references/charts.md) module of the `datachart` package provides various chart types to create data visualizations. The module is designed to be highly customizable and easy to use.

It offers a wide range of chart types, including line charts, bar charts, histograms, and more. The module allows users to customize the look and feel of their charts by providing attributes to control the colors, labels, and titles of the charts. The module also includes methods to create subplots, i.e., to display multiple charts in the same figure. This makes it easy to compare different data sets and highlight the details of each chart.
