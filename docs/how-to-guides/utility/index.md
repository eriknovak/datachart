# Utility

The [datachart.utils](../../references/utils/index.md) module of the `datachart` package provides various utility functions for data visualization.

These utility functions include:

- The [datachart.utils.OverlayChart](../../references/utils/index.md#datachart.utils.OverlayChart) function for combining multiple charts on a single plot with optional dual y-axes, as illustrated in the [overlay](overlay.ipynb) section.
- The [datachart.utils.stats](../../references/utils/stats.md) module for statistical calculations, as illustrated in the [stats](stats.ipynb) section.
