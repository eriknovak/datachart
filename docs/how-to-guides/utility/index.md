# Utility

The [datachart.utils](../../references/utils/index.md) module of the `datachart` package provides various utility functions for data visualization.

These utility functions include the [datachart.utils.save_figure](../../references/utils/index.md#datachart.utils.save_figure) function for saving figures into files, as showcased in the [charts](../charts/index.md) section.

In addition, it contains the [datachart.utils.stats](../../references/utils/stats.md) module for statistical calculations, as illustrated in the [stats](stats.ipynb) section.
